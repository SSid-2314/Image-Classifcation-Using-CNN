Cat and Dog Image Classification
This repository contains code for classifying images of cats and dogs using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of labeled images of cats and dogs, and then tested using a separate dataset to evaluate its performance.

Getting Started
To get started with using this project, follow these instructions:

Clone the repository to your local machine:   git clone https://[github.com/SSid-2314/cat-dog-image-classification](https://github.com/SSid-2314/Image-Classifcation-Using-CNN).git

Install the required dependencies:  pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the main script to train the model: python train.py

After training, you can test the model by providing test images manually or using the provided test dataset:   python test.py

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing contains labeled images of cats and dogs. 
You can use your own dataset or download a pre-existing dataset from sources like Kaggle or other repositories.

# Training
During the training phase, the model learns to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. 
The training data is used to adjust the model's parameters to minimize the prediction error.

# Testing
Once the model is trained, it can be tested using separate test images. 
These images can be provided manually or through a predefined test dataset. 
The model's performance is evaluated based on its accuracy in correctly classifying the test images.
